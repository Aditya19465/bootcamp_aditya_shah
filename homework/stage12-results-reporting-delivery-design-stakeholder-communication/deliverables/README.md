# Deliverables â€” README

## Audience
The intended audience for these deliverables is **non-technical business stakeholders** (e.g., product managers, leadership, and cross-functional partners). They are the decision-makers who need to understand **what the analysis means for business choices** rather than the technical details of statistical methods.

## Rationale
This audience requires **clear, concise, and actionable communication**:
- **Plain language summaries** highlight key assumptions, risks, and sensitivities without jargon.  
- **Visuals with brief takeaways** provide intuitive understanding of uncertainty and comparisons between methods.  
- **Decision implications** bullets focus on opportunities, risks, and next steps so the audience can act on insights.  

## Why Streamlit?
The results are delivered in a **Streamlit app**, which fits stakeholder needs because:
- It provides an **interactive and visual interface** instead of static charts or long technical documents.  
- Stakeholders can **explore model predictions, confidence intervals, and imputations** directly, without needing to code.  
- The app ensures **clarity and engagement**, letting users focus on *insights* rather than statistical details.  

## Usage
To launch the Streamlit app locally:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
