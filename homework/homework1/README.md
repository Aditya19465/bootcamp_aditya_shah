# Project Title
**Detection and Analysis of Forex Arbitrage Opportunities (2019–2024)**  
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)  

---

## Problem Statement
The foreign exchange (forex) market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with trillions of dollars traded daily.  
Even though prices adjust quickly, short-lived mispricings can occur due to market inefficiencies, leading to arbitrage opportunities.  
This project will analyze historical forex data from 2019 to 2024 for major currency pairs involving the Indian Rupee (INR), US Dollar (USD), and Euro (EUR), with a focus on identifying and evaluating potential arbitrage situations.  
We will examine two primary strategies: **triangular arbitrage** and **covered interest arbitrage**.

## Stakeholder & User
**Primary Stakeholder:** Institutional traders, currency desks at investment banks, quantitative hedge funds.  
**End Users:** Algorithmic trading developers, retail traders learning arbitrage mechanics, academic researchers in finance.  
**Timing & Workflow Context:** Results are most useful for backtesting automated strategies and for educational purposes in understanding market efficiency.

## Useful Answer & Decision
This project will deliver:
- **Descriptive insights** — historical frequency and size of arbitrage opportunities.
- **Predictive elements** — statistical probability of arbitrage in given volatility conditions.
- **Artifacts** — scripts to detect arbitrage and visualizations of arbitrage frequency over time.

---

## Assumptions & Constraints
- **Data Availability:** Historical spot and forward FX rates are available for USD/INR, EUR/USD, and EUR/INR.
- **Transaction Costs:** Analysis will be conducted both before and after accounting for bid–ask spreads and fees.
- **Constraints:** Real-world execution requires ultra-low latency; this study is a historical simulation.
- **Compliance:** Only public and licensed datasets will be used.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- True arbitrage profits may disappear when realistic transaction costs are included.
- Time-stamped precision is crucial; low-frequency data may miss opportunities.
- Market microstructure noise may create false signals.
