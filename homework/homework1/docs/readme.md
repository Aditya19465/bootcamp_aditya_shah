# Stakeholder Memo  
**Project:** Comparative Analysis of Bond Markets — India vs US (2019–2024)  
**Prepared for:** Institutional Investors, Financial Analysts, and Policy Advisors  
**Date:** August 2024  

---

## Purpose  
This project aims to deliver a clear, data-driven comparison of short-term and long-term bond market performance between India and the United States over the past five years.  
By analyzing 3-month and 5-year government bond yields from January 2019 to August 2024, we will evaluate relative performance, yield correlations, and theoretical opportunities for cross-country bond arbitrage, with a focus on **covered interest arbitrage**.

## Why This Matters  
Global fixed-income allocation decisions depend on understanding how yields behave across markets with different monetary policies, risk profiles, and growth trajectories.  
India represents a high-yield, emerging-market bond space with growing accessibility for foreign investors, while the US represents a stable, low-yield benchmark market.  
By assessing yield spreads, currency-adjusted returns, and interest rate parity conditions, investors can make more informed choices about diversification, hedging, and capital allocation.
