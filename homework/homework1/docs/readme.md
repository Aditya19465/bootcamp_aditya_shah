# Stakeholder Memo  
**Project:** Detection and Analysis of Forex Arbitrage Opportunities (2019–2024)  
**Prepared for:** Institutional Traders, Hedge Funds, and Quantitative Analysts  
**Date:** August 2024  

---

## Purpose  
This project aims to identify and evaluate historical forex arbitrage opportunities between major currency pairs involving the Indian Rupee (INR), US Dollar (USD), and Euro (EUR).  
The primary strategies studied will be:
1. **Triangular Arbitrage** — exploiting price differences between three currency pairs.
2. **Covered Interest Arbitrage** — using spot and forward exchange rates to lock in risk-free profits.

---

## Why This Matters  
In the real-world forex market, inefficiencies exist only briefly before being corrected by automated trading systems.  
However, studying these opportunities helps:
- Understand market efficiency.
- Test backtesting frameworks for algorithmic trading.
- Train financial analysts in arbitrage detection methods.
- Quantify the impact of transaction costs on profitability.

---

## Scope & Approach  
- **Currencies Studied:** INR, USD, EUR.
- **Pairs:** USD/INR, EUR/USD, EUR/INR.
- **Time Horizon:** Jan 2019 – Aug 2024.
- **Key Analyses:**
  - Detect triangular arbitrage opportunities using historical spot rates.
  - Test covered interest parity using spot and forward rates.
  - Compare theoretical and transaction-cost-adjusted profits.
- **Data Sources:** Public forex datasets (e.g., investing.com, central bank archives, paid APIs if available).

---

## Anticipated Outcomes  
- **Opportunity Map:** When and how often arbitrage opportunities occurred.
- **Profitability Estimates:** Gross vs net profits after spreads/fees.
- **Educational Value:** Practical examples of arbitrage detection for training purposes.
- **Limitations Report:** Why most retail traders cannot exploit these in real time.

## Next Steps & Deliverables  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** — Gather historical spot and forward rates.
2. **Exploratory Analysis** — Chart currency pair trends and volatility.
3. **Arbitrage Detection** — Implement detection algorithms for triangular and covered interest arbitrage.
4. **Final Output** — A report summarizing findings, code for detection, and visual dashboards.
