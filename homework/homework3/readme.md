# Homework 3 — Python Fundamentals

## 📌 Objective
Practice core Python, NumPy, and pandas skills by exploring a dataset, generating statistics, and writing reusable functions.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- **NumPy operations**  
  Created arrays, performed elementwise math, and compared loop vs vectorized execution.
- **Dataset loading**  
  Loaded `data/starter_data.csv` with pandas, inspected using `.info()` and `.head()`.
- **Summary statistics**  
  Generated `.describe()` and created groupby aggregations.
- **Reusable function**  
  Implemented `get_summary_stats(df)` for summary + grouping.
- **Output saved**  
  Exported results to `data/processed/summary.csv`.
- ⭐ *Bonus (if implemented)*: Created a basic plot and/or moved functions to `src/utils.py`.
